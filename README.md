# Texghter (pronounced 'texter')
A text-based fighter game of sorts

### Steps to play / run the game
1. Clone the repo
2. In the root of the folder, i.e., assuming the folder containing the files is called "texghter", run:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```
3. A `bin` directory should be created in the same folder.
4. Go to the `bin` directory, and run the `main` file in the terminal:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
   ... and hopefully have fun! :D
5. Use `Ctrl + C` to exit.
